<h2>Workflow is Orchestrated</h2>
<br>
<p>
    A user interface to manage relationships between Tasks and Users. 
    Some tasks have users assigned to them, so the relationship is one task to many users. 
    
    A user interface to update, create and delete these relationships from both the user perspective and task perspective. 
    Which users and tasks are editable are based on the ROLE of the user doing the updating. 
    
    This UI would allow the managers in respective departments to manage their task to user relationships.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Main Task</h2>
    <p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Create User and Task</li>
            <li>Create, Read, Update, Delete Task from Users</li>
            <li>One Task for Many Users </li>
            <li>Authentication (Only the manager can read and update task)</li>
            <li>Security on forms</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2>Documentation for User Model</h2>
<p>
    For the User Model, it will include the user id, full name, role in the team, authenticate to edit, and task number. 
    The full name will be required to be validated, which will be required in order to be stored inside the MySql Database. 
    The role of the team will be set to “member” if no role is assigned. 
    The authentication (true means the user is allowed to edit, false means the user is not allowed to edit). 
    If the user is allowed to edit, there will be update, delete, and create button showing on the page. Since, 
    the requirement said one to many relationship, each of the user only has one task at a time.

    The model of the task will include its id, task name, task detail and task due date.
    The task due date is not required, but the task name and task detail is required. Use the validate method in Backbone, 
    so the model can be saved into the MySql database only if it is valid.
